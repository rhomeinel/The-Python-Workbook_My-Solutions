# Introduction to Programming Exercises

The exercises in this chapter are designed to help you develop your analysis skills by
providing you with the opportunity to practice breaking small problems down into
sequences of steps. In addition, completing these exercises will help you become
familiar with Pythonâ€™s syntax. To complete each exercise you should expect to use
some or all of these Python features:

* Generate output with print statements
* Read input, including casting that input to the appropriate type
* Perform calculations involving integers and floating point numbers using Python
operators like +, -, *, /, //, %, and **
* Call functions residing in the math module
* Control how output is displayed using format specifiers


## Exercise 1: Mailing Address

Create a program that displays your name and complete mailing address formatted in
the manner that you would usually see it on the outside of an envelope. Your program
does not need to read any input from the user.

## Exercise 2: Hello

Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her name. The program should
respond with a message that says hello to the user, using his or her name.
